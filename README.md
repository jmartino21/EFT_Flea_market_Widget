What Is This Widget?
It's a simple tool that runs in the background while you're playing Escape from Tarkov. 
Whenever you come across an item in-game, just use the Snipping Tool (or any similar screenshot tool) to capture the item's name. 
The widget then automatically grabs this image from your clipboard, uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read the text, and fetches the current average market price for that item from the Tarkov Market API.

How to Set It Up:
Download the .exe: I'll provide a link to the executable file.

Install Tesseract OCR: The widget uses Tesseract OCR to read text from images. You can download it from here. Make sure to add Tesseract to your system's PATH or update the widget's script with the correct Tesseract path.

Antivirus Note: When you download and run the .exe, your antivirus might flag it. This is a common false positive with executables created by tools like PyInstaller.

API Key Requirement: To fetch item prices, you'll need your own API key from Tarkov Market. Once you have your key, enter it into the widget's configuration file.

How to Use It:
Open the widget before you start your game.
Whenever you find an item in Tarkov, just take a screenshot of its name.
The widget will automatically process the image, fetch the price, and display it in a small window.
Why Use This Widget?
It's all about efficiency and staying immersed in the game. No more alt-tabbing, no more guessing if an item is valuable or not. Just a quick screenshot and you get the info you need instantly.

Feedback and Suggestions:
I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvements. If you encounter any issues or have ideas on how to make the widget better, feel free to comment below or send me a message.

Hope you find this tool as helpful as I do. Happy raiding, and may your loot be ever valuable!
